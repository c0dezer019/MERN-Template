# MongoDB Express Backend

### Usage

- Create an env file to hide sensitive database information. NEVER PUSH TO VCS (version control 
  system).
- Everything is already setup in config so long as you name the environment variables as they are 
  provided in the config. If you name them something else you'll need to adjust config variables.
